# My Personal Site:
This site serves as a means of cataloguing my thoughts and ideas on various projects that I'm working on, and also as an incentive to motivate me to update stuff weekly. We'll see how that works out...

## Full Dive Virtual Reality (FDVR)
One of the things I really want to do is to create an FDVR platform, which would allow for the stimulation of all senses and reading motion input to achieve a complete immersion into a virtual world. This hardware, when combined with the correct software, could serve medical, educational, and, yes, enjoyment purposes.
