## Analysis:
### Methods:
Home stimulation occurred for 5 days every week. The electrodes were large, delivering current uniformly throughout the contact area, and placed by the patients themselves.

The first treatment used was long duration, high intensity biphasic stimulation - 120-150 ms/stimulation, 60-75 ms/pulse, 80V and 250 mA. After assessment by physicians, other training and stimulation patterns were used to try and enervate other muscles. These other training sessions lasted up to 30 minutes.

*Edit: See stimulation patterns addendum (coming soon)*

### Results:
The home stimulation program was able to conserve the size of slow fibres and revert atrophy of fast fibres. Additionally, the muscles themselves were able to deliver more force and knee torque, and patients were able to perform movements required for daily life (ex. knee extensions, stepping-in-place, standing, etc) However, this was the result of 2 years of FES therapy.
